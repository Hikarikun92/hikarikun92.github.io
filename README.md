Hello, and welcome to my personal website!

Here, you can find a little bit about me and my work as a **software developer specialist**.

### Carreer

Before I even knew what software development was, I had some classes in school in which they taught us about the **Logo** programming language. I used to have a lot of fun coding the exercises in class and at home, and I loved seeing the drawings the Logo Turtle made on screen - I was implementing algorithms without even knowing it.

My life as a software developer began in 2010, as I started my graduation course in Computer Engineering at **University of São Paulo**, in São Carlos - SP, Brazil. There, we learned mostly 2 programming languages: **C** and **Java**. People had strong and divided opinions for them: some preferred the low-level, high-speed controls of C (and some went to C++), and some (like me) loved the high-level and easy features of Java.

By the end of the graduation, I had to choose some optional classes to take in the last semesters, and that's when I discovered that there were classes in web development available. Soon, I got to learn the basics of Java EE, and that's what paved my way to where I am now.

In my last semester, in July 2014, I got hired as an intern at Bluedotsoft, a small software development company in my city, and some months later got hired there as a full-time employee. Even though the company was small, I acquired a huge knowledge and experience there, working with projects with legacy and modern technologies: [an educational training software](http://geic.ufscar.br/site/), [a communication-support project for journalism and academic publications](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACI_(software)), an educational iOS app (ABAcadabra - unfortunately, not available anymore), some ERP projects for different clients...

In April 2016 I got hired by Monitora - now [Marlabs](https://www.marlabs.com/pt-br/) -, where I currently work. There, I put my skills to work with further big challenges, working mostly for a global business aviation company from Europe, acting as a software developer for legacy and microservices applications. I further improved my development knowledge, working mostly with Java for the backend and JavaScript and ActionScript for the frontend. In 2020, I worked as a developer for some Brazilian companies and as a consultant for software architecture. In the same year, I started working on some projects for a global company responsible mainly for consumer credit reporting. After that, from 2022 on, I've been working on projects for a mobile phone service provider from the USA, managing flows from general system events, customer enrollment, promotions etc.

### Work skills

As a software developer, my main skills involve coding desktop and web applications, in both frontend and backend. I have knowledge in the following programming languages:
* Java (certified with Oracle's 1Z0-819-J exam)
* Kotlin
* Python
* JavaScript
* Go
* C
* Rust
* ActionScript
* C#
* Objective-C

At work, I have used mainly Java and JavaScript, with some quick tasks done in Python, ActionScript and Objective-C; outside of work, I have used the languages mostly in personal projects, some of them being available in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Hikarikun92/).

As for other tools, I have mainly worked with or studied:
* Libraries and frameworks: Java EE 6 and 7, Spring and Spring Boot (Java); Flask (Python); Gorilla Mux (Go); NodeJS, ReactJS, jQuery (JavaScript); PrimeFaces (JavaScript + Java); Adobe Flash + Apache Flex (ActionScript + Java)
* Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle) and NoSQL (MongoDB and Redis)
* Integration: SOAP and REST web services; messaging (JMS, Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ)
* Automated Tests: unit tests with JUnit, Python and Go; integration tests with Spring Test
* Mobile development: a little experience in Android (Java/Kotlin) and iOS (Objective-C) development

### Other skills

Besides the knowledge I have for work, I usually try to develop new skills as a hobby or just out of curiosity. Some things I did as personal goals:
* Languages: I'm fluent in Portuguese and English, and have a good knowledge of German.
* Translation: I once added Portuguese subtitles to [The Legend of Zelda animated series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-D1VRRcnVChjsfpp8HRw5-2R4_crF0D) along with some friends; I also started fan-translating some games from The Legend of Zelda and Ace Attorney series, but didn't get to release them.
* Video and audio editing: I like to create comedy videos and audios, mostly by editing existing ones in order to create funny mashups and remixes.
* Instruments: I used to play the piano, guitar and recorder (flute). It's been a long time since I've last played any of them, though.
