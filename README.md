Hello, and welcome to my personal website!

Here, you can find a little bit about me and my work as a **software developer specialist**.

### Carreer

Before I even knew what software development was, I had some classes in school in which they taught us about the **Logo** programming language. I used to have a lot of fun coding the exercises in class and at home, and I loved seeing the drawings the Logo Turtle made on screen - I was implementing algorithms without even knowing it.

My life as a software developer began in 2010, as I started my graduation course in Computer Engineering at **University of São Paulo**, in São Carlos - SP, Brazil. There, we learned mostly 2 programming languages: **C** and **Java**. People had strong and divided opinions for them: some preferred the low-level, high-speed controls of C (and some went to C++), and some (like me) loved the high-level and easy features of Java.

By the end of the graduation, I had to choose some optional classes to take in the last semesters, and that's when I discovered that there were classes in web development available. Soon, I got to learn the basics of Java EE, and that's what paved my way to where I am now.

In my last semester, in July 2014, I got hired as an intern at Bluedotsoft, a small software development company in my city, and some months later got hired there as a full-time employee. Even though the company was small, I acquired a huge knowledge and experience there, working with projects with legacy and modern technologies: [an educational training software](http://geic.ufscar.br/site/), [a communication-support project for journalism and academic publications](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACI_(software)), an educational iOS app (ABAcadabra - unfortunately, not available anymore), some ERP projects for different clients...

In April 2016 I got hired by [Monitora](https://www.monitoratec.com.br/), where I currently work. There, I put my skills to work with further big challenges, working mostly for a global business aviation company from Europe, acting as a software developer for legacy and microservices applications. I further improved my development knowledge, working mostly with Java for the backend and JavaScript and ActionScript for the frontend. In 2020, I worked as a developer for some Brazilian companies and as a consultant for software architecture. In the same year, I started working on some projects for a global company responsible mainly for consumer credit reporting.
